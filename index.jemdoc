== About me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the CSE department of HKUST supervised by
[https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/ Prof. Shuai Wang]. Before that, I received my
Mphil degree from the IoT Thrust, Information Hub under the supervision of
[https://songzli.github.io/ Prof. Songze Li]. I received my bachelor degree of
electronic information engineering from the Excellence class, School of
Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, where I
worked with Prof. Hailin Cao. 

== Research
My research interests include 
- AI Security with a recent focus on LLMs
- Model Editing and its security applications
- Backdoors Attacks \& Defenses in Federated Learning 

My research journey began with developing secure federated learning (FL)
systems, which are especially resilient to backdoor attacks. For attack
algorithms, I investigated how adversaries could exploit sample relationships to
inject more durable backdoors ([https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/dai23a
ICML'23]). For defensive mechanisms, I proposed **proactive defenses via
out-of-distribution data**, which has stronger defense performance under strong
non-IID settings or long-term continusous injection scenarios. After receiving
client updates, the server can either employ indicator-based screening
([https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20862 Usenix Security'24]) or direct aggregation
([http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15674 arXiv'25]) to effectively eliminate backdoors.

During my PhD, my focus shifted to enhancing the security and reliability of
large language models (LLMs). I see model editing as a powerful technique to
hack or safeguard LLMs with minimal computational and data overhead. My work
identifies root causes behind the failures of existing model editing methods in
large-scale and context-rich settings and proposes targeted countermeasures
([https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11876 arXiv'25]). 

I am committed to advancing secure and trustworthy LLM systems. Feel free to
reach out if youâ€™re interested in discussing my research.
